"""P6 integration tests — guards for the worker block direct entry points.

Goal
----
These tests cover the two API surfaces shipped in P6 (``goosefs >= 0.1.3``):

* High-level one-liner: ``AsyncGoosefs.positioned_read`` /
  ``Goosefs.positioned_read``
* Low-level escape hatch: ``AsyncGoosefs.acquire_worker_for_block`` /
  ``Goosefs.acquire_worker_for_block`` / ``AsyncWorkerClient.connect`` /
  ``WorkerClient.connect``

This file asserts at two layers:

1. **Import-time guards** — always run, no cluster required. They check
   that the Python binding namespace exports the P6 classes and methods.
   This layer is the binding's API-contract regression line.
2. **Cluster behavior guards** — depend on ``GOOSEFS_MASTER_ADDR``. They
   verify that ``AsyncWorkerClient`` actually performs a gRPC handshake
   to a worker and that a fake ``block_id`` produces a worker-side
   ``RpcError`` — proving the binding no longer falls back to the high-
   level filesystem path on the client side.

Layer 2 deliberately does **not** depend on ``URIStatus.block_ids`` —
on a dev cluster running in "UFS-only / no-tier-cache" mode the master
may not have received any block report yet, so ``status.block_ids`` can
legitimately be empty (see the GooseFS Rust/Python/Java client stress
comparison docs, §3.4 Python section, for the discussion). Even in that
state, ``AsyncWorkerClient.connect(...) + read_block_positioned(fake_id)``
is enough end-to-end evidence that the binding hits the worker directly:
the worker rejects the request with a ``"Failed to read block ID=...
from tiered storage and UFS tier"`` message, which can only have come
from the worker — not from a client-side fallback.
